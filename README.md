## Elevator speech

**Assume meet Jeff Bezos from Amazon

I’m a senior college student study supply chain management and computer information system at W.P Carey School of Business at Arizona State University.

I was growing up in China and taking college education here in U.S. I experienced how innovation has changed our life. And I understand how difficult it is to redefining an old and accustomed product image by new technologies. From this perspective, no matter Amazon online bookstore toward Barnes & Noble or kindle e-reader toward traditional paper books, Amazon totally changed our lifestyle.

For the past several months, me and my team created couple remote mobile applications. We believe with the development of mobile device and rising demand of customer, intelligent terminal will become more and more popular. Just like you said “work backwards”, everything starts with what customer wants. 

It was a pleasure speaking with you.
